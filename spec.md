# Tech Tree Canvas — Circuit Building Game

## Project Overview

A circuit-building puzzle game with tech tree progression. Players design circuits on a canvas using logic gates, wires, and components to solve challenges. Features recipe discovery, achievement tracking, faction progression, and community sharing.

## Core Features

### Canvas System
- Interactive circuit canvas with grid snapping
- Drag-and-drop component placement
- Wire connection system between ports
- Circuit validation and simulation
- Multi-layer support for complex circuits

### Components
- Logic gates: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR
- Wire segments and junction points
- Input/output nodes
- Timer and counter components
- Memory elements
- Custom sub-circuit modules

### Progression System
- Tech tree with unlockable components
- Recipe discovery through experimentation
- Achievement system for milestones
- Faction reputation and rewards
- Challenge mode with puzzles

### Community Features
- Publish circuits to community gallery
- Browse and import community circuits
- Favorite and rate circuits
- Template library for common patterns
- Exchange/trade system between players

## Technical Stack
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Zustand for state management
- SVG-based canvas rendering
- Canvas validation engine
- Lazy loading for performance

### Data Models

#### Component Instance
```typescript
interface ComponentInstance {
  id: string;
  type: ComponentType;
  position: { x: number; y: number };
  rotation: number;
  parameters: Record<string, any>;
  connections: Connection[];
}
```

#### Circuit
```typescript
interface Circuit {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  components: ComponentInstance[];
  layers: Layer[];
  metadata: CircuitMetadata;
}
```

#### Recipe
```typescript
interface Recipe {
  id: string;
  inputs: ComponentType[];
  output: ComponentType;
  discoveredBy: string;
  timestamp: number;
}
```

## Performance Requirements
- Main bundle ≤512KB
- Lazy loading for all panel/modal components
- Virtualized lists for large circuit galleries
- Efficient canvas rendering with viewport culling
- Test coverage maintained at ≥4948 tests

## Design Language
- Dark theme with circuit-board aesthetic
- Cyan/green accent colors for active elements
- Monospace typography for technical feel
- Subtle glow effects for powered connections
- Grid pattern background
